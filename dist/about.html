                <p>My name is Sonali Sharma.I am a B.tech Computer Science Undergraduate in 3rd year,pursuing my B.tech(Hons) degree with specialization in Data Analytics from Galgotias University,Greater Noida. The major subjects that I have studied till
                    now are Data Structures and Algorithms,Design and Analysis of Algorithms,Data Mining and Warehousing,Introduction to Big Data. I have worked on many small projects in my following years of engineering and also participated in many
                    hackathons namely NASASpaceApp Challenge-2019,Dexterix 1.0 and 2.0,Hackerflow 2.O(Chandigarh University),Odessa Campus Hiring Hackathon.This emphasizes that I am having a pretty well experience of working in a team and reaching to
                    a point of solution in a fixed time-frame in various hackathons.Along with this,I am able to identify one of my strengths that I am a quick learner and "can learn by doing/working" and also adaptable to changing environments.
